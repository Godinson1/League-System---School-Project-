                            <p>This project deals with the design and implementation of a computerized sport league management system using Delta State as a case study.

                                    Sport is an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.
                                    A sports league is a group of sports teams or individual athletes  that compete against each other in a specific sport.
                                    Sport is generally recognized as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organizations such as the Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.
